2. Use the dot system to organize kids’ clothes
Whether it’s matching outfit gifts from Grandma or a hand-me-down from older siblings, there will be times when you’re confused as to what belongs to who. Whip out a permanent marker and try this: draw one dot on everything belonging to the oldest, two dots for the next oldest, and so on. Once an item gets passed down, you simply add a dot. Boom.


3. Say goodbye to lonely socks 
We’ve all been there: two socks enter, one sock leaves. Try supplying every family member with a mesh bag for their dirty socks. Then, just close the bags and throw them into the washing machine.


4. Save the ironing
In our book, if it’s not a dress shirt, why press it? Toss in the dryer with a damp dryer sheet on the “dewrinkle cycle” for about 20 mins and voila!

5. Write directions on the machines with dry-erase markers
This is the laundry version of leaving a note on the fridge. You can enlist everyone and tell them when it’s time to switch loads, what needs to air dry or which items may need special attention.


6. Unshrink clothes using conditioner
Soak your shrunk, washed garments in lukewarm water with ordinary hair conditioner for 15 minutes. Rinse the conditioner for 5 minutes, then wring the residual water out. Stretch the garments and allow them to air dry.
