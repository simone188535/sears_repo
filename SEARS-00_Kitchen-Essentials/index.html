					<p class="NoBullet">Having a fridge that does more than just open, close and stay cold is definitely a thing now!  Here&#39;s just a taste of what they can do:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Diagnose Problems</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">Finding someone to repair your fridge can be a real pain, and a lot of your food can wind up ruined before you even realize something&#39;s wrong.  LG<sup>&#174;</sup> SmartDiagnosis<sup>&#8482;</sup> and Kenmore Elite<sup>&#174;</sup> Smart App can connect you with tech support so you can get it fixed quickly. 
						</li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Track Expiration Dates</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">LG&#39;s SmartThinQ<sup>&#174;</sup> app will give you a poke when your eggs are going bad or your leftover milk should be dumped.</li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Be Your Shopping Assistant</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">We all go to the store and forget what the heck we need to buy, right? Now you can use your phone to sync with SmartThinQ<sup>&#174;</sup> to see if you already bought yogurt yesterday or if you need more lettuce for the week.</li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Bring It All to Your Fingertips</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">SmartThinQ<sup>&#174;</sup> allows you to control temp and other fridge functions from your phone, even when you&#39;re not home. The fridge doors come with touchscreens that can be used to build a shopping list or access other info. LG also has doors you can see through! Just knock twice and the Instaview<sup>&#8482;</sup> Door-in-Door<sup>&#174;</sup> glass panels let you look inside without letting out the cold air.</li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Talk to You</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">Why swipe when you can talk? SmartThinQ<sup>&#174;</sup> can interface with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.</li>

					<p>You know when you go to the movie theatre, airport or hotel and they have those cool, magic faucets that turn on all by themselves? Well, now you can have one (or more) of these easy add-ons in your very own kitchen.</p>
					<div class="blueheader TopItem SubHeader">Bluetooth Tech</div>
					<p >Thanks to brands like GE<sup>&#174;</sup>, there are a lot of cool tricks available for creating tasty dishes at home, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Sous Vide</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">For aspiring chefs, sous vide is a pro-level of cooking that&#39;s tricky to pull off. Well, pine for fine dining no more. There are now Bluetooth-enabled sous vide accessories available that talk to your cooktop, keeping the temp exactly where it needs to be while you attend to other things. 
						</li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">ChefConnect<sup>&#8482;</sup></li>
						<li class="NoBullet">GE&#39;s ChefConnect<sup>&#8482;</sup> tech enables the Profile Series range to connect with your microwave so you can sync clocks as well as turn on lights and vents. </li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Touch and Swipe Controls</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">Induction cooktops are very popular at the moment because they&#39;re fast warming with great simmering control. Now you can get touch and swipe controls for your smart phone! All you have to do is drag your finger to the temps you need for each burner. </li>

					<ul>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Black is the New Stainless</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">Black stainless steel has risen to the top of the pop charts, the vanguard of interior design. It&#39;s durable and resistant to fingerprints, which means less smudging. It&#39;s also versatile and looks great alongside your other gadgets if you’re not looking to replace everything. Black stainless is also understated enough to slide in nicely with old fashioned homes, as well as more modern ones.
						</li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Go with Gray-toned</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">Another hot ticket is gray-toned with a dark brushed metal finish. This is a nice departure from traditional all-white appliances.</li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Try New Tiling</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">For wall tiling, try a beveled, sculpted or stacked backsplash. Natural stone tiles are nice as well. </li>
						<li class="blueheader TopItem">Open Up Your Shelving</li>
						<li class="NoBullet">You can use metal tubing for an industrial feel or rough-cut wood for a natural look.  </li>
